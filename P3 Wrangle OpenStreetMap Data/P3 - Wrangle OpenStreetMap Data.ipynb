    "It's clear from what we've seen that the Beach Cities OpenStretMap data is still very much incomplete. It isn't entirely surprising, as these areas do not match the size and popularity of other parts of Los Angeles - i.e. Santa Monica, Downtown LA - but there is still much in these cities to be found and explored. The upside is that a lot of the data that has been entered is fairly clean, so future OSM users who embark on the task of improving the dataset with new information won't have much to worry about with regards to cleaning prior submissions. I'm looking forward to seeing how the data for the area grows overtime, and I hope to also play a role in that mission myself. "
